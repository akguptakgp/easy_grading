{Exp_4_conn_Conjunction Furthermore Exp_4_conn} {Exp_4_Arg2 , there was an established law prohibiting airships from flying to low over urban areas ; this made it illegal for a dirigible to tether itself to the Empire State Building and further cemented the impossibility for the builders in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there .

{NonExp_3_Arg1 {Exp_1_Arg2 The workers {Exp_1_conn_Conjunction also Exp_1_conn} had to face the fact that overall , the mooring mast was too dangerous to use . Exp_1_Arg2} NonExp_3_Arg1}

{NonExp_5_Arg1 {NonExp_4_Arg2_EntRel The dirigibles used outside of the United States used a gas they created a dangerous risk for accidents . NonExp_4_Arg2} NonExp_5_Arg1}
{NonExp_6_Arg1 {NonExp_5_Arg2_Conjunction Another battle the builders had to face was the strong winds . NonExp_5_Arg2} NonExp_6_Arg1}

{NonExp_6_Arg1 {NonExp_5_Arg2_Cause This made it impossible for any dirigible to dock or even come near the Empire State Building . NonExp_5_Arg2} NonExp_6_Arg1}

{NonExp_0_Arg1 The main obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there stemmed from the bad location . NonExp_0_Arg1}

{NonExp_2_Arg1 {NonExp_1_Arg2_Conjunction This would create three problems for the docking of the dirigibles . NonExp_1_Arg2} NonExp_2_Arg1}

{NonExp_0_Arg1 In this short passage , it discusses how architects want to build a mooring mast on the Empire State Building in the state of New York . NonExp_0_Arg1}
{NonExp_1_Arg1 {NonExp_0_Arg2_Cause This mast would dock dirigibles , which in modern day they 're called blimps . NonExp_0_Arg2} NonExp_1_Arg1}
{NonExp_2_Arg1 {NonExp_1_Arg2_EntRel The mooring mast is a skinny tower at the top of the Empire State Building to dock the Dirigibles . NonExp_1_Arg2} NonExp_2_Arg1}
{NonExp_3_Arg1 {NonExp_2_Arg2_EntRel Empire State Building stands @ NUM1 feet tall without the mooring mast at peak . NonExp_2_Arg2} NonExp_3_Arg1}
{NonExp_4_Arg1 {NonExp_3_Arg2_EntRel The stress of a dirigible on a mooring mast at @ NUM2 feet is a lot of weight at that high of a structure . NonExp_3_Arg2} NonExp_4_Arg1}
{NonExp_5_Arg1 {NonExp_4_Arg2_EntRel They put @ MONEY1 of modifications into this deal for the base area of the building . NonExp_4_Arg2} NonExp_5_Arg1}
{NonExp_6_Arg1 {NonExp_5_Arg2_Restatement An important downfall about the dirigibles are that with helium in them , they 're very flammable and could cost several millions in damage . NonExp_5_Arg2} NonExp_6_Arg1}
{NonExp_7_Arg1 {NonExp_6_Arg2_Cause {Exp_0_conn_Condition If Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 the zeppelin caught on flame over such a densely populated land area , Exp_0_Arg2} {Exp_0_Arg1 that could take a large amount of lives . Exp_0_Arg1} NonExp_6_Arg2} NonExp_7_Arg1}
{Attr_0 {NonExp_8_Arg1 {NonExp_7_Arg2_Cause {Exp_1_Arg1 I think Attr_0} the mooring mast was a great idea Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Conjunction and Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 it helped the building be the tallest building at one time . Exp_1_Arg2} NonExp_7_Arg2} NonExp_8_Arg1}

*************************************************

{NonExp_0_Arg1 Due to the architects being blind to the potential problems of the mast , the builders of the Empire State building faced many obsticles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there . NonExp_0_Arg1}
{NonExp_1_Arg1 {NonExp_0_Arg2_EntRel There was a law saying that airships could not fly too low over urban areas . NonExp_0_Arg2} NonExp_1_Arg1}

{NonExp_2_Arg1 {Exp_0_conn_Contrast But Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 say a ship got tethered to the mooring mast , the back end of the ship would swivel around the mass due to constant shifting winds because of violent air currents . Exp_0_Arg2} NonExp_2_Arg1}
{NonExp_3_Arg1 {NonExp_2_Arg2_EntRel Dirigibles are normally moored in open fields which allows the backs to be weighted down with lead weights . NonExp_2_Arg2} NonExp_3_Arg1}
{NonExp_4_Arg1 {NonExp_3_Arg2_Conjunction {Exp_1_Arg1 This was dangerous for many reasons but mainly Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Cause because Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 the weights would be hanging over downtown New York . Exp_1_Arg2} NonExp_3_Arg2} NonExp_4_Arg1}
{NonExp_5_Arg1 {NonExp_4_Arg2_Cause Without the dirigible being held down the violent winds would push the ship into sharp spires that would rip the shell . NonExp_4_Arg2} NonExp_5_Arg1}
{NonExp_6_Arg1 {NonExp_5_Arg2_Cause With the wind pressure and the dirigibles load itself there would be too much stress being added to the buildings frame . NonExp_5_Arg2} NonExp_6_Arg1}
{NonExp_7_Arg1 {NonExp_6_Arg2_Conjunction The buildings steel frame , over sixty thousand dollars in modifications would have {Exp_2_Arg1 to be made Exp_2_Arg1} {Exp_2_conn_Cause so Exp_2_conn} {Exp_2_Arg2 the stress would be able to be transmitted nearly eleven hundred feet down to the foundation Exp_2_Arg2} . NonExp_6_Arg2} NonExp_7_Arg1}
{NonExp_8_Arg1 {NonExp_7_Arg2_Cause Most of the dirigibles that were made out of the united states used hydrogen rather than helium . NonExp_7_Arg2} NonExp_8_Arg1}
{NonExp_9_Arg1 {NonExp_8_Arg2_EntRel {Exp_3_Arg1 Hydrogen is more flamable Exp_3_Arg1} {Exp_3_conn_Cause so Exp_3_conn} {Exp_3_Arg2 the owners of the Empire state building realized {Exp_4_Arg1 how worse the accident could have been Exp_4_Arg1} {Exp_4_conn_Condition if Exp_4_conn} {Exp_4_Arg2 it were over downtown New York Exp_4_Arg2} .

{NonExp_0_Arg1 In their quest to allow dirigibles to dock , the architects and builders of the Empire State Building ran into many problems . NonExp_0_Arg1}

{NonExp_4_Arg1 {NonExp_3_Arg2_Conjunction the winds in the airspace @ NUM1 feet in the air were not only strong but constantly shifting due to violent air currents so forceful that even `` the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles ... could not get close enough to tie up . NonExp_3_Arg2} NonExp_4_Arg1}

{NonExp_0_Arg1 The builders of the Empire State Building faced several problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there . NonExp_0_Arg1}

{NonExp_2_Arg1 {NonExp_1_Arg2_EntRel This was due to the fact that a dirigible held by a cable would add stress to the building 's frame . NonExp_1_Arg2} NonExp_2_Arg1}
